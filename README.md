## About

AccountLite CLI is a lightweight accounting software with recording financial transactions (no inventory management available), classification(ledgers), and summarization(trial balance). The data is stored in a human readable format (which is very similar to CSV).

## Getting Started
### As User

### As Developer
âš  You must have [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) installed and setup on your computer. Check by typing `g++ --h` in your command line.

#### Windows
1. Clone the repo and enter the folder
2. Run `make.bat` or `./make.bat`

#### Linux & Mac
1. Clone the repo and enter the folder
2. Run `make.sh` or `./make.sh`
